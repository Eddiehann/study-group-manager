Project Summary:

Our database models key aspects of academic collaboration and productivity 
among students. It supports how students form study groups, organize, 
and attend study sessions. The database tracks groups, sessions, and subjects
 or other materials. It also links sessions to locations and provides access to 
 study resources related to each course. Students can leave reviews on other 
 students. These features together model real-life academic routines like group
  study planning, shared learning resources, and feedback after collaborative 
  sessions.
